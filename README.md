Introduction:
=====

>  ZaraHood implement an Architecture which is mantainable many way to enhance ;)

ZaraHood is my play project, where test my learnings and other architectures with my current stable tech-stack <br>It's pretty close implementation of full-fledged application, complete with Network Requests, Material Design and equiped with depencency injection which makes it easier for other developers to contribute on feauture and system development.   

It developed with well tested code cherries like **Kotlin**, **Coroutines**, **Jetpack** & **AndroidX**.
<br>
It's a well packaged code base

ZaraHood is built to some well maintanaible project code base . I'm not a UX guy ,bt still try to design application for ease of use inspired from day-today web-sites/apps. Fade Transitions are just pretty much easy to acchive :D

have some play to try around with differnt library to get reach in more developer ease :B

Build Instructions:
=====

1. Just Clone the Project

2. Gradle Sync and Rebuild

Design Decisions & Dependencies:
=====

### [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/):

I am in love with Kotlin, looking at this transition in android development from java world to kotlin writing this beautiful code which is 

### [JetPack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack) - Architecture Components & AndroidX:
Would be a loss to build an application without these libraries. With Google advocating MVVM, and these libraries working so flawlessly with each other, it really leaves you with no other choice.
<br>**ViewModel** - Data safeguarding across system configuration changes
<br>**Lifecycle** - surfing the issues with Activities / Fragments namely when pushing data
<br>**AndroidX, Material Components** - For embracing Material Design and backporting API features to minSdk

### some Gems

- [Dependency Updates Plugin](https://github.com/ben-manes/gradle-versions-plugin)
